```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
```

### Data In

```{r}
sp_launches <- read.csv(here("data", "space_launches.csv"))

view(sp_launches)
```




```{r}
# Make new data file for Mission
launch <- sp_launches %>% 
  filter(type %in% c("Delta 4H", "H11B", "Tsiklon-2")) %>% 
  group_by(mission)

```



Plot away

```{r}
ggplot(data = launch, aes(x = launch_year, y = mission)) +
  geom_jitter(fill = "green",
           color = "purple",
           bins = 100) 

  


```
